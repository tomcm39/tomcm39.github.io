      <description>&lt;p&gt;Students will expand their statistics and machine learning toolkit by building traditional regression models for continuous and binary data, explore supervised learning methods such as: Tree-based learning, KNN/Collaborative filtering, and Feed forward Neural networks, and understand how to manipulate, ask, and answer questions from big datasets. Students will be expected to propose a population health project mid-semester, and apply and present techniques they learned in class. May be taken in conjunction with BSTA 103.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Population Health Data Science I (PHDS-I) students will spend the semester learning the fundamentals of probability theory, univariate statistics, statistical computing, and machine learning. A mix of traditional and experiential learning will focus on how to build an analysis pipeline to answer pressing questions in population health. In-class examples and projects will use real data sets. Examples include: comparing cardiovascular interventions in clinical trials, evaluating the incidence of influenza in the United States, and visualizing international health expenditures and burdens. Students will propose a small data-driven project focused in population health, and use their newly-acquired data science skills to collect, analyze, and present their work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a constant tension between keeping our data private and the need to collect, store, and use private data to support health sciences decisions making.
National databases like NHANES, FluView, MAUDE, and NSSP collect data on individuals&#39; demographic data, disease states, adverse events.
They collect data on emergency room visits, reported malfunctions during procedures, and symptoms consistent with influenza (influenza-like illness).
To collect data like this, patients/participants accept a risk that their data will be compromised and made public&amp;mdash;that their identity will be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of Data Privacy and Security (DPS) is to reduce, to as small as possible, the chance a participant&amp;rsquo;s data becomes public knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what follows, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss a definition of privacy, the importance of privacy and HIPAA, the goals of data security and how to ensure your data is secured, approaches to DPS, current challenges in DPS, and a future vision.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This class will build on the ideas you developed in introductory and intermediate statistics courses.
We&amp;rsquo;ll study state-of-the-art regression-based statistical methods, computational tools for data analysis, and apply them to real data sets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Math020 Fundementals of Calculus II (UVM)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fundamentals of Calculus II is the second course in our two-course applied calculus sequence. Fundamentals of Calculus II is a continuation of the study of the calculus of functions of one variable as well as a study of multivariable calculus. This will include area between curves, integration by parts, basic differential equations, separation of variables, solving first-order linear differential equations, Taylor Polynomials and Tayler Series, improper integrals, continuous random variables and probability, functions of several variables, partial derivatives, maxima and minima of multivariable functions, Lagrange multipliers, and double integrals. This basically covers chapters 6 â€“ 11 of the textbook given below. Topics will be presented with a level of depth and rigor appropriate for students pursuing degrees in business, economics, social and life sciences. Please speak to the Department of Mathematics and Statistics if you are unsure if you are taking the correct calculus course.&lt;/p&gt;
