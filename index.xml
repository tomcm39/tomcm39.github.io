      <description>&lt;p&gt;Students will expand their statistics and machine learning toolkit by building traditional regression models for continuous and binary data, explore supervised learning methods such as: Tree-based learning, KNN/Collaborative filtering, and Feed forward Neural networks, and understand how to manipulate, ask, and answer questions from big datasets. Students will be expected to propose a population health project mid-semester, and apply and present techniques they learned in class. May be taken in conjunction with BSTA 103.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aggregating probabilistic predictions of the safety, efficacy, and timing of a COVID-19 vaccine</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Safe, efficacious vaccines were developed to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. But in the middle of 2020, vaccine effectiveness, safety, and the timeline for when a vaccine would be approved and distributed to the public was uncertain. To support public health decision making, we solicited trained forecasters and experts in vaccinology and infectious disease to provide monthly probabilistic predictions from July to September of 2020 of the efficacy, safety, timing, and delivery of a COVID-19 vaccine. We found, that despite sparse historical data, a consensus&amp;ndash;a combination of human judgment probabilistic predictions&amp;ndash;can quantify the uncertainty in clinical significance and timing of a potential vaccine. The consensus underestimated how fast a therapy would show a survival benefit and the high efficacy of approved COVID-19 vaccines. However, the consensus did make an accurate prediction for when a vaccine would be approved by the FDA. Compared to individual forecasters, the consensus was consistently above the 50th percentile of the most accurate forecasts. A consensus is a fast and versatile method to build probabilistic predictions of a developing vaccine that is robust to poor individual predictions. Though experts and trained forecasters did underestimate the speed of development and the high efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, consensus predictions can improve situational awareness for public health officials and for the public make clearer the risks, rewards, and timing of a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aggregating Statistical Models and Human Judgment to forecast COVID-19</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forecasting the trajectory of the US COVID-19 pandemic can support public health officials who make decisions with partial knowledge of how the virus will evolve over time. Computational models are capable of processing large, structured datasets. However the trajectory of COVID-19 depends on information inaccessible to computational models such as social, economic, and political influences. We aim to collect monthly probabilistic predictions from experts in the modeling of infectious disease and trained, generalist human forecasters about key targets that signal changes in the trajectory of the US COVID-19 pandemic. Predictions from humans will be (i) aggregated into a consensus forecast and (ii) combined with an ensemble of computational models, called a metaforecast. In January we collected 779 human judgment predictions on 7 targets related to COVID-19. We compared forecasts from: (i) an ensemble of computational models called the COVID-19 Forecasthub (Fhub), (ii) a consensus of human predictions and (iii) a metaforecast–a combination of the consensus and Fhub. Preliminary results for predictions of national incident cases and deaths made for the last week in January show the consensus outperformed the Fhub when predicting deaths but the Fhub made a more accurate prediction of incident cases. The metaforecast’s accuracy was between that of the consensus and Fhub. A consensus can provide forecasts of pandemic targets similar in accuracy to an ensemble of computational models. A consensus, as opposed to an ensemble, is not limited by the type of questions asked and we have asked the crowd a diverse set of questions about the pandemic. But because a consensus requires human effort we are limited by the number of questions we can ask. We aim to combine the best of both worlds by drawing on computational models and consensus of human judgment to support how public health officials translate novel information about the virus into mitigation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Population Health Data Science I (PHDS-I) students will spend the semester learning the fundamentals of probability theory, univariate statistics, statistical computing, and machine learning. A mix of traditional and experiential learning will focus on how to build an analysis pipeline to answer pressing questions in population health. In-class examples and projects will use real data sets. Examples include: comparing cardiovascular interventions in clinical trials, evaluating the incidence of influenza in the United States, and visualizing international health expenditures and burdens. Students will propose a small data-driven project focused in population health, and use their newly-acquired data science skills to collect, analyze, and present their work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A consensus of probabilistic predictions by experts and trained forecasters of the timing and efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine</title>

      <guid>https://thomasmcandrew.com/talk/a-consensus-of-probabilistic-predictions-by-experts-and-trained-forecasters-of-the-timing-and-efficacy-of-a-sars-cov-2-vaccine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A safe, effective vaccine is a key component to slowing the spread of SARS- CoV- 2. But a recent poll suggests less than 50% of the US public would volunteer for inoculation, highlighting uncertainty surrounding the safety and efficacy of a vaccine. We solicited 9 infectious disease experts and 11 trained forecasters to predict: when the FDA will approve a vaccine, when 100M doses will be available to the public, and to estimate an approved vaccine’s efficacy. For the past four months, we have asked experts and trained forecasters to provide probabilistic predictions related to the timing and efficacy of a SARS- CoV- 2 vaccine. At the end of each month we (i) combined predictions using an equally-weighted linear pool, (ii) created a report that contained key findings and a detailed description of questions and consensus predictions, (iii) made this report and the data used to create it available to the CDC and public. A total 20 experts and forecasters made 537 predictions over 26 questions. A consensus of experts and trained forecasters predict a median of Jan. 2021 [80%CI: Oct. 2020, Nov. 2021] for when the FDA will approve a SARS- CoV-2 vaccine and a median of 18 weeks after approval [80%CI: 5.0, 50.0] for when 100M doses will be available to the public. Experts’ median prediction of efficacy was 50% [80%CI: 26%, 76%] for the first approved vaccine. An expert consensus provides realistic estimates of a COVID-19 solution with the goal of improving public awareness, public health communication, and decision making. Experts can quantify their predictions with a probabilistic distribution. Predictions are timely and based on up- to- date information. Experts predict: a vaccine will likely be approved by Jan. 2021 and that 100M doses will be available within 5 months of approval, but this vaccine may not be efficacious enough to achieve herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An expert judgment model to predict early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States</title>
      <link>https://thomasmcandrew.com/publication/mcandrew-2020-expert/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://thomasmcandrew.com/publication/mcandrew-2020-expert/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From February to May 2020, experts in the modeling of infectious disease provided quantitative predictions and estimates of trends in the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in a series of 13 surveys. Data on existing transmission patterns were sparse when the pandemic began, but experts synthesized information available to them to provide quantitative, judgment-based assessments of the current and future state of the pandemic. We aggregated expert predictions into a single “consensus prediction” by taking an equally weighted average of their probabilistic statements. At a time when few computational models made public estimates or predictions about the pandemic, expert judgment provided (a) falsifiable predictions of short- and long-term pandemic outcomes related to reported COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, (b) estimates of latent viral transmission, and (c) counterfactual assessments of pandemic trajectories under different scenarios. The consensus approach of aggregating expert predictions provided more consistently accurate predictions than any individual expert, although the predictive accuracy of a consensus rarely provided the most accurate prediction. This work highlights the importance that expert consensus could play in flexibly assessing a wide array of risks early in future emerging outbreaks, especially in settings where available data cannot yet support data-driven computational modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Population Health Data Science I (PHDS-I) students will spend the semester learning the fundamentals of probability theory, univariate statistics, statistical computing, and machine learning. A mix of traditional and experiential learning will focus on how to build an analysis pipeline to answer pressing questions in population health. In-class examples and projects will use real data sets. Examples include: comparing cardiovascular interventions in clinical trials, evaluating the incidence of influenza in the United States, and visualizing international health expenditures and burdens. Students will propose a small data-driven project focused in population health, and use their newly-acquired data science skills to collect, analyze, and present their work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a constant tension between keeping our data private and the need to collect, store, and use private data to support health sciences decisions making.
National databases like NHANES, FluView, MAUDE, and NSSP collect data on individuals&#39; demographic data, disease states, adverse events.
They collect data on emergency room visits, reported malfunctions during procedures, and symptoms consistent with influenza (influenza-like illness).
To collect data like this, patients/participants accept a risk that their data will be compromised and made public&amp;mdash;that their identity will be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of Data Privacy and Security (DPS) is to reduce, to as small as possible, the chance a participant&amp;rsquo;s data becomes public knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what follows, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss a definition of privacy, the importance of privacy and HIPAA, the goals of data security and how to ensure your data is secured, approaches to DPS, current challenges in DPS, and a future vision.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aggregating Expert Opinion on COVID-19</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Community-wide transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in the US on February 26th. Since the virus was declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11th, it has spread rapidly throughout the US and has caused more than 1.1M confirmed cases and 62K deaths. Forecasts provide public health officials at the state and federal level actionable information that can be used to mitigate the impact of an outbreak in advance. But forecasts from computational models often depend heavily on noisy surveillance data and take a large amount of work to build. Without guidance from forecasts, public health must rely on sparse past experiences to inform intervention. An expert consensus forecast, synthesizing both objective and subjective information, can be developed quickly and make predictions during the early phase of an outbreak, when computational models are still being built. In addition, an expert judgment model can address changing public health needs by asking different questions without much overhead. Each week from February 17th (early in the outbreak) to present we asked experts to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. More than 40 experts made predictions that provided early information to public health officials. Over two months, experts made 4 predictions of the number of deaths in the US by the end of 2020 and gave median predictions between 150,000 to 250,000 deaths. Corresponding 80% prediction intervals of the number of deaths were generated and the minimum lower bound was 19.0K and maximum upper bound was 1.2M. Experts also estimate that, as of Apr 27th, there are over 14.5 million total SARS-CoV-2 cases present in the US with an 80% prediction interval of 4.8M to 28.1M. US national-level hospitalizations, experts predict, will most likely peak between April and June. Expert’s estimates agree with other computational model forecasts, and expert’s 80% prediction intervals covered the true number of confirmed cases in the US on nine out of ten evaluable predictions. An expert consensus has little overhead and can be deployed early in an outbreak to provide decision makers insight into an evolving disease. After computational models are built, experts can examine a broad array of questions to complement computational forecasts during a global catastrophe such as the novel coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Re-Thinking the Role of Statistics in Informing Heart Team Decisions: A Consensus Distribution Approach</title>
      <link>https://thomasmcandrew.com/publication/mcandrew-2020-re/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To build a heart team consensus distribution, a biostatistician would ask each member of the team to independently provide a probability distribution, for example a survival curve, of an adverse outcome  (blue lines) for different treatments a single patient may decide to undergo. Those individual predictions are then combined with a statistical algorithm. A common method to aggregate predictions into a consensus is a linear pool14, a weighted average of the heart team’s probability distributions (red line). Past work has shown consensus distributions outperform individual forecasts 15. The heart team consensus and their individual predictions can be compiled and sent to all members of the team and the patient to better inform optimal treatments. We stress that the consensus prediction would belong to a single patient, not an aggregate of patients like a traditional statistical model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We present three combination forecasting techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FluSight Network (FSN) ensemble model is a multimodel ensemble; a
convex combination of component predictive densities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adaptive ensemble is a multimodel ensemble, but unlike the FSN
ensemble, recomputes component model weights every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beta-transformed linear pool (BLP), proposed by Ranjan and
Gneiting (2010), models an ensemble transformed by a Beta distribution&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seasonal Influenza infects an average 30 million people in the United States every year, overburdening hospitals during weeks of peak incidence.Named by the CDC as an important tool to fight the damaging effects of these epidemics, accurate forecasts of influenza and influenza like illness (ILI) forewarn public health officials about when, and where, seasonal influenza outbreaks will hit hardest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensemble forecasts have shown positive results in forecasting 1 to 4 week ahead ILI percentages better than any single model in an ensemble.But current ensemble forecasts are static within a season, training on past ILI data before the season begins and generating optimal weights for each model kept constant throughout the season.We propose a novel adaptive ensemble forecast capable of changing model weights week-by-week throughout the flu season, only needing current flu season data to make predictions, and able to moderate ensemble weights with a prior chosen through cross-validation.At the start of the season, without any data, models are weighted equally, and after observing how the ensemble&amp;rsquo;s models perform on week ahead forecasts, a variational inference algorithm updates model weights and forecasts the next 4 weeks of ILI percentages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our adaptive ensemble performs as well as the static ensemble in the US national and regional level (mean % dif.in log-score between adaptive and static ensemble = 1.1;upper 97.5CI =1.4) and better for more sparse seasons (e.g. Season 2011/2012;mean = -2.9;95CI = [-3.7, -2.1];p&amp;lt;0.01).The choice of prior (equal across models) also affects adaptive ensemble performance, finding the best logscore with a prior weight equal to 8% of the training data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In settings without substantial past data (i.e. emerging pandemics) or when new models do not have a long track-record of performance, an adaptive ensemble approach will be the only option for performance-based weighting of models, enhancing the public health impact of ensemble forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Influenza prediction can better prepare public health officials for seasonal outbreaks. We propose an adaptive multi-model ensemble forecast method that changes model weights week-by-week throughout the flu season. Without historical training data or when models do not have a track-record, an adaptive model can enhance the public health impact of ensemble forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Combining human intuition with machine measurements for sharper estimates of left ventricular ejection fraction</title>
      <link>https://thomasmcandrew.com/talk/combining-human-intuition-with-machine-measurements-for-sharper-estimates-of-left-ventricular-ejection-fraction/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://thomasmcandrew.com/talk/combining-human-intuition-with-machine-measurements-for-sharper-estimates-of-left-ventricular-ejection-fraction/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the most commonly used clinical measure of systolic function and is a powerful predictor of outcomes.  Current guidelines recommend using the biplane method of discs (MOD) (modified Simpson’s rule) to measure LVEF however the accuracy of this measurement is dependent on endocardial border detection and orthogonal, on-axis biplane imaging, and studies report both inter and intraobserver variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: In this analysis, we sought to reduce measurement error by fusing the cardiologist&amp;rsquo;s visual approximation of LVEF with the biplane MOD. Furthermore, we hypothesized that this new assimilated LVEF will better correlate with clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: We studied intermediate surgical risk patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis from the PARTNER-IIA Trial treated with either surgical or transcatheter bioprosthetic aortic valves, who had core-lab assessments of both a visual estimate and a biplane MOD measurement of LVEF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: Assimilating the core lab cardiologist’s visual estimate with the biplane MOD estimate, reduces variability by 28.7% on average compared to the biplane MOD estimate alone. After accounting for LVEF measurement error, the assimilated LVEF shrank confidence intervals for the association between LVEF&amp;lt; 35% and the composite of 1 year cardiovascular death compared to biplane MOD (pvalue &amp;lt; 0.01)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Combining an experienced echocardiographer’s visual estimates and biplane MOD measurements, can reduce reproducibility errors in LVEF measurement and improve the association between LVEF and cardiovascular mortality at 1 year in a large, population-based study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Math020 Fundementals of Calculus II (UVM)</title>
      <link>https://thomasmcandrew.com/project/example/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://thomasmcandrew.com/project/example/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fundamentals of Calculus II is the second course in our two-course applied calculus sequence. Fundamentals of Calculus II is a continuation of the study of the calculus of functions of one variable as well as a study of multivariable calculus. This will include area between curves, integration by parts, basic differential equations, separation of variables, solving first-order linear differential equations, Taylor Polynomials and Tayler Series, improper integrals, continuous random variables and probability, functions of several variables, partial derivatives, maxima and minima of multivariable functions, Lagrange multipliers, and double integrals. This basically covers chapters 6 – 11 of the textbook given below. Topics will be presented with a level of depth and rigor appropriate for students pursuing degrees in business, economics, social and life sciences. Please speak to the Department of Mathematics and Statistics if you are unsure if you are taking the correct calculus course.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What we write about when we write about causality</title>
      <link>https://thomasmcandrew.com/talk/what-we-write-about-when-we-write-about-causality/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://thomasmcandrew.com/talk/what-we-write-about-when-we-write-about-causality/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Identifying and communicating relationships between causes and effects is important for understanding our
world, but is affected by language structure, cognitive and
emotional biases, and the properties of the communication
medium. Despite the increasing importance of social media,
much remains unknown about causal statements made online.
To study real-world causal attribution, we extract a large-scale
corpus of causal statements made on the Twitter social network
platform as well as a comparable random control corpus. We
compare causal and control statements using statistical language
and sentiment analysis tools. We find that causal statements
have a number of significant lexical and grammatical differences
compared with controls and tend to be more negative in sentiment
than controls. Causal statements made online tend to focus on
news and current events, medicine and health, or interpersonal
relationships, as shown by topic models. By quantifying the
features and potential biases of causality communication, this
study improves our understanding of the accuracy of information
and opinions found online.&lt;/p&gt;
