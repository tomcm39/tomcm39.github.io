To support public health decision making, we solicited trained forecasters and experts in vaccinology and infectious disease to provide monthly probabilistic predictions from July to September of 2020 of the efficacy, safety, timing, and delivery of a COVID-19 vaccine. We found, that despite sparse historical data, a consensus\u0026ndash;a combination of human judgment probabilistic predictions\u0026ndash;can quantify the uncertainty in clinical significance and timing of a potential vaccine. The consensus underestimated how fast a therapy would show a survival benefit and the high efficacy of approved COVID-19 vaccines. However, the consensus did make an accurate prediction for when a vaccine would be approved by the FDA. Compared to individual forecasters, the consensus was consistently above the 50th percentile of the most accurate forecasts. A consensus is a fast and versatile method to build probabilistic predictions of a developing vaccine that is robust to poor individual predictions. Though experts and trained forecasters did underestimate the speed of development and the high efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, consensus predictions can improve situational awareness for public health officials and for the public make clearer the risks, rewards, and timing of a vaccine.\n","date":1623801600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622848692,"objectID":"c85210e52f919765cd33749f9da23ed9","permalink":"https://thomasmcandrew.com/publication/mcandrew-2021-vaccine/","publishdate":"2021-06-04T23:21:01.990881Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mcandrew-2021-vaccine/","section":"publication","summary":"Safe, efficacious vaccines were developed to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Computational models are capable of processing large, structured datasets. However the trajectory of COVID-19 depends on information inaccessible to computational models such as social, economic, and political influences. We aim to collect monthly probabilistic predictions from experts in the modeling of infectious disease and trained, generalist human forecasters about key targets that signal changes in the trajectory of the US COVID-19 pandemic. Predictions from humans will be (i) aggregated into a consensus forecast and (ii) combined with an ensemble of computational models, called a metaforecast. In January we collected 779 human judgment predictions on 7 targets related to COVID-19. We compared forecasts from: (i) an ensemble of computational models called the COVID-19 Forecasthub (Fhub), (ii) a consensus of human predictions and (iii) a metaforecast–a combination of the consensus and Fhub. Preliminary results for predictions of national incident cases and deaths made for the last week in January show the consensus outperformed the Fhub when predicting deaths but the Fhub made a more accurate prediction of incident cases. The metaforecast’s accuracy was between that of the consensus and Fhub. A consensus can provide forecasts of pandemic targets similar in accuracy to an ensemble of computational models. A consensus, as opposed to an ensemble, is not limited by the type of questions asked and we have asked the crowd a diverse set of questions about the pandemic. But because a consensus requires human effort we are limited by the number of questions we can ask. We aim to combine the best of both worlds by drawing on computational models and consensus of human judgment to support how public health officials translate novel information about the virus into mitigation efforts.\n","date":1622592000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622592000,"objectID":"6b97773e2baae85618cfc7f8a0c42c04","permalink":"https://thomasmcandrew.com/talk/aggregating-statistical-models-and-human-judgment-to-forecast-covid-19/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/aggregating-statistical-models-and-human-judgment-to-forecast-covid-19/","section":"event","summary":"Forecasting the trajectory of the US COVID-19 pandemic can support public health officials who make decisions with partial knowledge of how the virus will evolve over time.

But a recent poll suggests less than 50% of the US public would volunteer for inoculation, highlighting uncertainty surrounding the safety and efficacy of a vaccine. We solicited 9 infectious disease experts and 11 trained forecasters to predict: when the FDA will approve a vaccine, when 100M doses will be available to the public, and to estimate an approved vaccine’s efficacy. For the past four months, we have asked experts and trained forecasters to provide probabilistic predictions related to the timing and efficacy of a SARS- CoV- 2 vaccine. At the end of each month we (i) combined predictions using an equally-weighted linear pool, (ii) created a report that contained key findings and a detailed description of questions and consensus predictions, (iii) made this report and the data used to create it available to the CDC and public. A total 20 experts and forecasters made 537 predictions over 26 questions. A consensus of experts and trained forecasters predict a median of Jan. 2021 [80%CI: Oct. 2020, Nov. 2021] for when the FDA will approve a SARS- CoV-2 vaccine and a median of 18 weeks after approval [80%CI: 5.0, 50.0] for when 100M doses will be available to the public. Experts’ median prediction of efficacy was 50% [80%CI: 26%, 76%] for the first approved vaccine. An expert consensus provides realistic estimates of a COVID-19 solution with the goal of improving public awareness, public health communication, and decision making. Experts can quantify their predictions with a probabilistic distribution. Predictions are timely and based on up- to- date information. Experts predict: a vaccine will likely be approved by Jan. 2021 and that 100M doses will be available within 5 months of approval, but this vaccine may not be efficacious enough to achieve herd immunity.\n","date":1604275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604275200,"objectID":"8e04825abcdb121b35a6f05ea66aa32e","permalink":"https://thomasmcandrew.com/talk/a-consensus-of-probabilistic-predictions-by-experts-and-trained-forecasters-of-the-timing-and-efficacy-of-a-sars-cov-2-vaccine/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/a-consensus-of-probabilistic-predictions-by-experts-and-trained-forecasters-of-the-timing-and-efficacy-of-a-sars-cov-2-vaccine/","section":"event","summary":"A safe, effective vaccine is a key component to slowing the spread of SARS- CoV- 2.

We aggregated expert predictions into a single “consensus prediction” by taking an equally weighted average of their probabilistic statements. At a time when few computational models made public estimates or predictions about the pandemic, expert judgment provided (a) falsifiable predictions of short- and long-term pandemic outcomes related to reported COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, (b) estimates of latent viral transmission, and (c) counterfactual assessments of pandemic trajectories under different scenarios. The consensus approach of aggregating expert predictions provided more consistently accurate predictions than any individual expert, although the predictive accuracy of a consensus rarely provided the most accurate prediction.

US national-level hospitalizations, experts predict, will most likely peak between April and June. Expert’s estimates agree with other computational model forecasts, and expert’s 80% prediction intervals covered the true number of confirmed cases in the US on nine out of ten evaluable predictions. An expert consensus has little overhead and can be deployed early in an outbreak to provide decision makers insight into an evolving disease. After computational models are built, experts can examine a broad array of questions to complement computational forecasts during a global catastrophe such as the novel coronavirus.\n","date":1590710400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590710400,"objectID":"98cff15012f5bd7581c129b9f13dd15d","permalink":"https://thomasmcandrew.com/talk/aggregating-expert-opinion-on-covid-19/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/aggregating-expert-opinion-on-covid-19/","section":"event","summary":"Community-wide transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in the US on February 26th.

Current guidelines recommend using the biplane method of discs (MOD) (modified Simpson’s rule) to measure LVEF however the accuracy of this measurement is dependent on endocardial border detection and orthogonal, on-axis biplane imaging, and studies report both inter and intraobserver variability.\nObjectives: In this analysis, we sought to reduce measurement error by fusing the cardiologist\u0026rsquo;s visual approximation of LVEF with the biplane MOD. Furthermore, we hypothesized that this new assimilated LVEF will better correlate with clinical outcomes.\nMethods: We studied intermediate surgical risk patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis from the PARTNER-IIA Trial treated with either surgical or transcatheter bioprosthetic aortic valves, who had core-lab assessments of both a visual estimate and a biplane MOD measurement of LVEF.\nResults: Assimilating the core lab cardiologist’s visual estimate with the biplane MOD estimate, reduces variability by 28.7% on average compared to the biplane MOD estimate alone. After accounting for LVEF measurement error, the assimilated LVEF shrank confidence intervals for the association between LVEF\u0026lt; 35% and the composite of 1 year cardiovascular death compared to biplane MOD (pvalue \u0026lt; 0.01)\nConclusions: Combining an experienced echocardiographer’s visual estimates and biplane MOD measurements, can reduce reproducibility errors in LVEF measurement and improve the association between LVEF and cardiovascular mortality at 1 year in a large, population-based study.\nK\n","date":1529625600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529625600,"objectID":"5f0417839a0bcf0921ec238378bea356","permalink":"https://thomasmcandrew.com/talk/combining-human-intuition-with-machine-measurements-for-sharper-estimates-of-left-ventricular-ejection-fraction/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/combining-human-intuition-with-machine-measurements-for-sharper-estimates-of-left-ventricular-ejection-fraction/","section":"event","summary":"Background: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the most commonly used clinical measure of systolic function and is a powerful predictor of outcomes.

Fundamentals of Calculus II is a continuation of the study of the calculus of functions of one variable as well as a study of multivariable calculus. This will include area between curves, integration by parts, basic differential equations, separation of variables, solving first-order linear differential equations, Taylor Polynomials and Tayler Series, improper integrals, continuous random variables and probability, functions of several variables, partial derivatives, maxima and minima of multivariable functions, Lagrange multipliers, and double integrals. This basically covers chapters 6 – 11 of the textbook given below. Topics will be presented with a level of depth and rigor appropriate for students pursuing degrees in business, economics, social and life sciences.

Despite the increasing importance of social media, much remains unknown about causal statements made online. To study real-world causal attribution, we extract a large-scale corpus of causal statements made on the Twitter social network platform as well as a comparable random control corpus. We compare causal and control statements using statistical language and sentiment analysis tools. We find that causal statements have a number of significant lexical and grammatical differences compared with controls and tend to be more negative in sentiment than controls. Causal statements made online tend to focus on news and current events, medicine and health, or interpersonal relationships, as shown by topic models. By quantifying the features and potential biases of causality communication, this study improves our understanding of the accuracy of information and opinions found
