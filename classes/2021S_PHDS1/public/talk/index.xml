      <description>Seasonal Influenza infects an average 30 million people in the United States every year, overburdening hospitals during weeks of peak incidence.Named by the CDC as an important tool to fight the damaging effects of these epidemics, accurate forecasts of influenza and influenza like illness (ILI) forewarn public health officials about when, and where, seasonal influenza outbreaks will hit hardest.
Ensemble forecasts have shown positive results in forecasting 1 to 4 week ahead ILI percentages better than any single model in an ensemble.</description>

      <description>Influenza prediction can better prepare public health officials for seasonal outbreaks. We propose an adaptive multi-model ensemble forecast method that changes model weights week-by-week throughout the flu season. Without historical training data or when models do not have a track-record, an adaptive model can enhance the public health impact of ensemble forecasts.</description>

      <title>Assimilated LVEF: Combining human intuition with machine measurements for sharper estimates of left ventricular ejection fraction</title>

      <description>Background: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the most commonly used clinical measure of systolic function and is a powerful predictor of outcomes. Current guidelines recommend using the biplane method of discs (MOD) (modified Simpsonâ€™s rule) to measure LVEF however the accuracy of this measurement is dependent on endocardial border detection and orthogonal, on-axis biplane imaging, and studies report both inter and intraobserver variability.
Objectives: In this analysis, we sought to reduce measurement error by fusing the cardiologist&amp;rsquo;s visual approximation of LVEF with the biplane MOD.</description>

      <description>Cyber-physical systems are critical infrastructures that are crucial both to the reliable delivery of resources such as energy, and to the stable functioning of automatic and control architectures. These systems are composed of interdependent physical, control and communications networks described by disparate mathematical models creating scientific challenges that go well beyond the modeling and analysis of the individual networks. A key challenge in cyber-physical defense is a fast online detection and localization of faults and intrusions without prior knowledge of the failure type.</description>

      <description>Identifying and communicating relationships between causes and effects is important for understanding our world, but is affected by language structure, cognitive and emotional biases, and the properties of the communication medium. Despite the increasing importance of social media, much remains unknown about causal statements made online. To study real-world causal attribution, we extract a large-scale corpus of causal statements made on the Twitter social network platform as well as a comparable random control corpus.</description>
