Eq and bifurcations A differential equation relates a function to it\u0026rsquo;s derivatives. For more general systems involving many different functions, a system of differential equations relates the set of functions to their derivatives.\nFor example, $$ \\begin{equation} \\frac{dy}{dt} = y\\sin(t) \\end{equation} $$ and $$ \\begin{equation} A \\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}} + B\\frac{dy}{dt} + C = 0, \\end{equation} $$ are differential equations. The first describes $y$ using the first derivative only, the second equation involving $y$\u0026rsquo;s first and second derivatives.\nThe goal of any differential equation (difeq) is finding a solution, finding a function $f$ that satisfies all the constraints imposed by the difeq. Looking at our first example diffeq., a solution would be a function $y(t)$ such that the first derivative equals $y(t) \\times \\sin(t)$. The function $y_{1}(t) = e^{t^{2}}$ would not be a solution,\n$$ \\begin{equation} \\frac{dy_{1}}{dt} = 2t e^{t^{2}} = 2t y_1 \\neq y_1 \\sin(t). \\end{equation} $$\nbut $ y(t) = k e^{-\\cos(t)} $, $k$ a constant, is a solution (check). Given a starting point $(t_0,y_0)$ the solution (red) oscillates, at greater magnitude for larger positive and negative $y$ values (Fig).\nAs another example, consider the diff eq. $$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = 5-x^2 $$\nLacking any external influencers, a solution like the one above can completely describe the system. When a system can be influenced by external forces, more is needed to describe the system.\nConsider the diffeq. $$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x|r) = r-x^2 $$\nCritical Slowing Down Influenza like illness ","date":1560189989,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560189989,"objectID":"a5056b69487e1e09c1ed5f49b32d126f","permalink":"https://thomasmcandrew.com/classes/2020F_PHDS1/public/post/critical-slowing-down-influenza/","publishdate":"2019-06-10T14:06:29-04:00","relpermalink":"/classes/2020F_PHDS1/public/post/critical-slowing-down-influenza/","section":"post","summary":"I'll give a brief overview of Dif.

Furthermore, we hypothesized that this new assimilated LVEF will better correlate with clinical outcomes.\nMethods: We studied intermediate surgical risk patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis from the PARTNER-IIA Trial treated with either surgical or transcatheter bioprosthetic aortic valves, who had core-lab assessments of both a visual estimate and a biplane MOD measurement of LVEF.\nResults: Assimilating the core lab cardiologist’s visual estimate with the biplane MOD estimate, reduces variability by 28.7% on average compared to the biplane MOD estimate alone.

These systems are composed of interdependent physical, control and communications networks described by disparate mathematical models creating scientific challenges that go well beyond the modeling and analysis of the individual networks. A key challenge in cyber-physical defense is a fast online detection and localization of faults and intrusions without prior knowledge of the failure type. We describe a set of techniques for the efficient identification of faults from correlations in physical signals, assuming only a minimal amount of available system information. The performance of our detection method is illustrated on data collected from a large building automation system.\n","date":1471824000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1471824000,"objectID":"632a6f89907081d406219c756707b418","permalink":"https://thomasmcandrew.com/classes/2020F_PHDS1/public/talk/2016cnls/","publishdate":"2016-08-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/classes/2020F_PHDS1/public/talk/2016cnls/","section":"talk","summary":"Cyber-physical systems are critical infrastructures that are crucial both to the reliable delivery of resources such as energy, and to the stable functioning of automatic and control architectures.

Despite the increasing importance of social media, much remains unknown about causal statements made online. To study real-world causal attribution, we extract a large-scale corpus of causal statements made on the Twitter social network platform as well as a comparable random control corpus. We compare causal and control statements using statistical language and sentiment analysis tools. We find that causal statements have a number of significant lexical and grammatical differences compared with controls and tend to be more negative in sentiment than controls. Causal statements made online tend to focus on news and current events, medicine and health, or interpersonal relationships, as shown by topic models. By quantifying the features and potential biases of causality communication, this study improves our understanding of the accuracy of information and opinions found online.\nKeywords social media; online social network; causal attribution; natural language processing\n","date":1471824000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1471824000,"objectID":"ed87702789602c901f9c445b15d7ce97","permalink":"https://thomasmcandrew.com/classes/2020F_PHDS1/public/talk/2016whatwe/","publishdate":"2016-08-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/classes/2020F_PHDS1/public/talk/2016whatwe/","section":"talk","summary":"Identifying and communicating relationships between causes and effects is important for understanding our world, but is affected by language structure, cognitive and emotional biases, and the properties of the communication medium.
